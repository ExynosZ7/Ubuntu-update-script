# 🛠️ Ubuntu Update Script

A simple and automated **bash script** to update, upgrade, and clean up your Ubuntu system. This script is ideal for anyone who wants to streamline system maintenance through the terminal.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

* Updates package lists
* Upgrades installed packages
* Removes unnecessary packages

> 💡 A basic understanding of the Linux terminal is recommended.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

* A Debian-based system (like Ubuntu)
* Basic terminal knowledge
* A text editor (e.g., `nano` or `vim`)

---

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

### 1. Create the Script

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
nano update.sh
```

This will open a file in the **nano** text editor. Paste the following code into the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y
```

> 🧠 **Note**: `#!/bin/bash` is called a **shebang**, which tells the system to run the script with bash.

---

### 2. Save and Exit

In **nano**, press:

* `CTRL + O` → Save the file
* `ENTER` → Confirm file name
* `CTRL + X` → Exit the editor

---

### 3. Make the Script Executable

Run the following command:

```bash
chmod +x update.sh
```

Verify permissions:

```bash
ls -l update.sh
```

You should see an `x` in the permissions (e.g., `-rwxr-xr-x`).

---

### 4. Run the Script

Use `sudo` to execute:

```bash
sudo ./update.sh
```

Enter your password when prompted. Your system will now update automatically.

---

## 📂 Optional: Move Script to Your `~/bin` Directory

For easier access from anywhere:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin
mv update.sh ~/bin
```

Then run it from anywhere using:

```bash
~/bin/update.sh
```

Or add `~/bin` to your `$PATH` for even easier usage:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

---

## 🧾 Tips

* Use `nano` if you're new to terminal editors
* [Download a Nano or Vim cheat sheet](https://www.cheatography.com) if needed
* Always review what the script does before running it with `sudo`
